# LEAM

LEAM adapts the syntax-guided encoder-decoder architecture by extending a set of grammar rules specific to our mutation task, to guarantee syntactic correctness of constructed mutation faults. It predicts the statements to be mutated under the context of the targeted method to reduce search space, and then predicts grammar rules for mutation fault construction based on both semantic and structural features in AST.

## 1. Environment

* Python 3.7
* PyTorch 1.3
* Defects4J V1.0
* Java 8



## 2. A Demo

Pleas find our built model at: <https://huggingface.co/anonymoussss/leam/blob/main/best_model.ckpt>. Download the model and place it in folder `LEAM/checkpointSearch/`.

We provide a demo to generate mutation faults for JFree Chart on fiexd version.

Please run `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python3 testDefect4jV1Fixed.py Chart-1` in the `LEAM/` folder directory. The generated mutation faults are saved as JSON in the `LEAM/mutants/` folder directory.

(1) `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1`: specify two available GPUs.
(2) `Chart-1`: `project name` and `bug id`.
